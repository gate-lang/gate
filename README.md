# GATE

A functional programming language that combines the concise syntax of C with explicit memory management. Its functional paradigm emphasizes functions as building blocks, offering improved code readability and the ability to use powerful concepts like recursion and higher-order functions. GATE is a versatile tool suitable for small scripts or large-scale applications.

This is a to-be-legacy repository. As soon as gate gets mature enough, we'll stop using Rust, and Gate will be written entirely in itself.

## Building

Gate uses cargo as its default package manager, so you just need it if you want to compile gate by yourself.

```sh
cargo build
```
